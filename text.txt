CHAPTER ONE
The New Puppy
My name is John Grogan and I love dogs. When I was ten years old,
my father gave me my first dog. I called him Shaun.
Shaun was my best friend. He went everywhere with me and he was
very obedient. When I called him, he came to me. He played with me and
he walked next to me without a leash. In the car, he sat next to me quietly.
After many years, Shaun died. He was fourteen years old. By that
time, I wasn't a boy; I was a man. I had my first job.
Shaun was a great dog. I wanted to get another dog, but it had to be as
wonderful as Shaun.
Some years later, I moved to Florida and married Jenny. Jenny and I
had jobs with newspapers. We were very happy. We were young and in
love, and life was wonderful.
One day, I bought a plant for Jenny. It was very large, with beautiful
white flowers. Jenny loved it - maybe too much. Every day, she gave it
water. In the end, the plant got sick and died.
Some days later, I woke up early. Jenny wasn't in bed. I found her at
the table with a newspaper. She had a red pen in her hand.
"Jenny," I said, "what are you doing?"
She showed me the newspaper. It was open at a page of ads. "Look at
this, John," she said.
I saw an ad with a big red line under it:
Beautiful Labrador puppies. Five weeks old.
